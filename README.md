## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the MetroWealth project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed.
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
*   A Firebase project set up.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mutheejj/metrowealth
    cd metrowealth
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Firebase Setup:**
    *   Set up a new Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password sign-in method).
    *   Enable **Firestore Database**.
    *   Configure your Flutter app for Firebase according to the [official FlutterFire documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup). This typically involves adding configuration files like `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) to your project, and running `flutterfire configure`.
    *   Apply the Firestore security rules found in `firestore.rules`. You can deploy them using the Firebase CLI: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

4.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholder values with your actual SMTP credentials (e.g., from MailerSend):

    ```dotenv
    # .env file
    SMTP_HOST=smtp.mailersend.net
    SMTP_PORT=587
    SMTP_USERNAME=your_mailersend_smtp_username
    SMTP_PASSWORD=your_mailersend_smtp_password
    SMTP_FROM_NAME=MetroWealth App
    ```

    *   _Ensure the `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive credentials._

## üèÉ Running the App

1.  Ensure you have a connected device (emulator or physical device).
2.  Run the following command from the project root:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
